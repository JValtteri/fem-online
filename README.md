## Description

A single page web-app for making simple strain calculations for simple beams and struts. Despite the name, this isn't a true FEM calculator, but a simpler strain calculator. Usually you don't need to make complex calculations to estimate the strength of a part or assembly.

The aim was to make a fast, intuitive and easy to use calculator for the most common cases.
